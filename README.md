This project presents a calculator that can do the basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

This calculator supports numbers between Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER and Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER (2^53 - 1 < n < -(2^53 - 1)). The current implementation also rounds numbers up to the 5th decimal place and the display can handle up to 16 numbers at once.

Keyboard support has also been added (Except for +/-)!\
